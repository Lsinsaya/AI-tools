How to make a cupcake 

 

Here is a basic recipe and steps for making cupcakes: 

 

Ingredients: 

 

1 3/4 cups (220g) all-purpose flour 

1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 

1/2 teaspoon salt 

1/2 cup (115g) unsalted butter, softened 

1 cup (200g) granulated sugar 

2 large eggs 

2 teaspoons vanilla extract 

3/4 cup (180ml) milk 

Instructions: 

 

Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line a 12-count muffin pan with cupcake liners. 

In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside. 

In a large bowl, beat the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy, about 2-3 minutes. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla extract. 

Alternate mixing in the flour mixture and milk in three additions, beginning and ending with the flour mixture. Mix just until combined after each addition. 

Divide the batter evenly among the prepared muffin cups, filling them about 2/3 full. 

Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. 

Allow the cupcakes to cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely. 

Once cooled, frost with your desired frosting or simply dust with confectioners' sugar. 

Frosting Options: 

 

Buttercream 

Cream Cheese Frosting 

Chocolate Ganache 

Whipped Cream 

Variations: 

 

Add mix-ins like chocolate chips, sprinkles, or fruit to the batter 

Make them festive with food coloring 

Top with crushed cookies, candies, or other decorations 

The keys are creaming the butter and sugar well, alternating dry and wet ingredients, and not over-mixing. Adjust baking time as needed based on your oven. Enjoy your fresh homemade cupcakes!
