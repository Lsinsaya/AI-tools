## Prompts

For the first prompt I started with an example similar to what we used in the playbook.

* Prompt #1*: 
* "Suggest beautiful places to see on an road trip in Washington state.”

Output:
> Washington state is a land of diverse beauty, offering everything from cascading mountains and lush rainforests to dramatic coastlines and rolling farmlands. To help you plan your road trip, here are some of the most beautiful places to see: 

Olympic Peninsula: This region is home to Olympic National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The park is famous for its temperate rainforests, wildflower meadows, and snow-capped mountains. You can hike through old-growth forests to see massive trees, explore tide pools along the rocky coast, or go storm watching in the winter.

Mount Rainier National Park: This park is dominated by Mount Rainier, the tallest mountain in the Cascade Range. Visitors can enjoy stunning views of the mountain, hike through wildflower meadows, or go camping or fishing in one of the park's many lakes.

Palouse Scenic Byway: This scenic drive winds through the rolling hills of eastern Washington, passing wheat fields, orchards, and quaint towns. The byway is especially beautiful in the spring, when the hills are carpeted with wildflowers.

This is just a starting point, of course. There are many other beautiful places to see in Washington state. With its diverse landscapes and charming towns, Washington is a great place for a road trip. Be sure to do some research to find the places that interest you the most and to plan your route accordingly. 

* Prompt #2*: 
* "How people used to dress up before first revolution ”

Output:
> The first revolution you might be referring to is likely the American Revolution. Here's a breakdown of how people dressed before the American Revolution (around the 1700s): 

Social Class Matters: 

Upper Class: Wealthy colonists followed the latest fashions from Europe, especially England and France. Men wore knee-length breeches, waistcoats, long coats, and tricorn hats. Women donned elaborate gowns with full skirts, stays (corsets), and lace trimmings. 

Middle Class: These folks dressed more simply but still aimed to look neat and respectable. Men wore breeches, waistcoats, and less decorated coats. Women wore simpler gowns and fewer frills. 

Lower Class: The working class wore practical clothing for their labor. Men wore trousers or breeches made of sturdy fabrics like wool or linen, and simple shirts. Women wore simple dresses or skirts and blouses of practical materials. 

Materials and Simplicity in the Colonies: 

Compared to Europe, colonists generally dressed in a more simple style. 

Fabric choices were influenced by what was available locally. Wool, linen, and leather were common. Silk and finer fabrics were expensive and used more sparingly. 

Remember: 

This is a general overview. Fashion varied depending on location and even individual taste. 

Children's clothing resembled simpler versions of adult styles. 

 
* Prompt #3*: 
* "How copper is extracted? Please generate a image of the process ”

Output:
> How copper is extracted? Please generate a image of the process  

I can't generate images of that. Try asking me to generate images of something else. 

Discussion:

It is easy to use. It has the options to modify the response (shorter, longer, simple, more casual, or professional).  
Gemini may display inaccurate info, including about people, so double-check its responses

Observations: 

Gemini is an easy to use AI tool. It is recommended for beginners. It is available in all US states, however, it has some restrictions for the European continent, as well as for educational google accounts. I tried to open AI with UW account and could not do it.
